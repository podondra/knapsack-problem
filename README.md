## 0-1 knapsack problem

Given a set of *n* items numbered from 1 up to *n*,
each with a weight *w_i* and a value *v_i*,
along with a maximum weight capacity *W*,

maximize *v\_1 * x\_1 + v\_2 * x\_2 + ... + v\_n * x\_n*

subject to *w\_1 * x\_1 + w\_2 * x\_2 + ... + w\_n * x\_n <= W*

Find a set of *X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}*,
where *x_i* is element of *{0, 1}*.
