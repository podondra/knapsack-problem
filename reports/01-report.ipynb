    "Given whole number $n$ (number of things), whole number $M$ (knapsack capacity),\n",
    "finite set $W = \\{w_1, w_2, \\dots , w_n\\}$ (things' weights),\n",

    "Construct set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n\\}$ where all $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$,\n",

    "## Analysis of Possible Solution Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage there are two method possible. First is *brute force method*. It tries all possible configurations and return optimal solution. Second method is based on *heuristic* inserting according to ratio of price and weight. Solution by heuristic fill the knapsack fast, but it can find suboptimal solution."

    "### Brute Force Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method remember the best cost of solution and corresponding configurations.\n",
    "For every configuration it check the constrain and compute the optimization criterion.\n",
    "Its value is compared to the best value computed so far and if needed the best value is modified.\n",
    "After testing all configurations the method has the optimal solution saved.\n",
    "Complexity of this method is $\\Theta(n2^n)$ where $n$ is instance size because count of all possible knapsack\n",
    "fillings is $2^n$ and for each of them constrain and optimization criterion has to be computed in time $\\Theta(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates ratio of price and weight ($\\frac{c_i}{w_i}$) for each thing.\n",
    "According to this ratio the thing are sorted in descending order\n",
    "(if the ratio is the same then the lighter thing is preferred).\n",
    "Things are inserted into the knapsack in the sorted order until the knapsack is full.\n",
    "Heuristic method's complexity is $O(n\\log{n})$ because complexity of sorting Python function `sorted()` is\n",
    "$O(n\\log{n})$ (viz [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort))\n",
    "and complexity of knapsack filling is only $O(n)$."

    "From measured data is obvious that for big instances is use of brute force method not usable because of vast computational complexity.\n",

    "From figure 2 can be inferred that as size of instance grows so the relative error is smaller\n",

    "Therefore brute force method should be use fro small instances\n",
